										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – (August 31, 2022) – The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) today issued an <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/65299/informed-investor-advisory-metaverse/">Informed Investor Advisory</a> cautioning investors to protect themselves from investment scams and frauds offered in the unregulated metaverse, the online virtual “world” that provides users with immersive experiences through virtual or augmented reality technologies.</p>
<p>According to the advisory, the metaverse may offer numerous potential investment opportunities, including virtual real estate, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and other businesses. But the advisory warns that the lack of regulation in the metaverse, combined with the ability to operate from anywhere in the world, make it easy for fraudsters to hide their financial schemes. In addition, security lapses on some developing platforms and the ability to build fake metaverse experiences can lead to hacks, fraud, or the theft of users’ funds.</p>
<p>“Investors should keep in mind that every investment comes with risk, and no investment can be guaranteed against loss,” said NASAA President and Maryland Securities Commissioner Melanie Senter Lubin. “Our experience with so-called investment opportunities found in the metaverse, is that we see the same old financial scams simply dressed in new clothes and offered to investors in the metaverse. Investors need to be wary of any investment that is promising unrealistic returns with minimal risk.”</p>
<p>The advisory, which was developed by NASAA’s Investor Education Alerts and Advisories Project Group, explains the  risk of metaverse-focused investment scams and frauds, and how investors can protect themselves if they are considering investing in this emerging realm.</p>
<p>“It is important to do research before participating in any investment opportunity to learn if it is a legitimate offering and whether it is registered with one or more securities regulators,” said Diane Young-Spitzer, NASAA’s Investor Education Alerts and Advisories Project Group Chair, Board member, and Massachusetts Securities Division Director and General Counsel.</p>
<p>NASAA provides the following tips to help investors identify common telltale signs of possible investment fraud in the metaverse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the risks and make sure you are comfortable with them, including the possibility that you might lose your entire investment.</li>
<li>Verify that the investment and person/entity offering the investment scheme are registered with one or more securities regulators. To find the contact information for your securities regulator <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/contact-your-regulator/">visit NASAA’s online directory</a>.</li>
<li>Avoid discussing investments or sharing personal or account information with avatars, or digital representations of users that can take on any appearance or personal attribute. Fraudsters may try to leverage shared interests, ideas, and goals to build trust and convince investors to invest in phony investment schemes.</li>
<li>Steer clear of metaverse crypto or NFT investment offers and avoid investment advice in the metaverse.</li>
<li>Be wary of misinformation including fake news and online celebrity gossip as scammers write fake online articles and social media posts that create buzz by falsely stating a celebrity or public figure is involved in technology investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investors should know that the rules that apply to investments in the physical world also apply to investments in virtual worlds. When considering any investment, you should watch for signs of fraud, and objectively consider all the information available to you before purchasing it. If you suspect fraud or illegal activity, contact your state or provincial <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/contact-your-regulator/">securities regulator</a> immediately.</p>
<p>The easiest way to protect yourself from investment fraud is to contact the securities regulator in your jurisdiction to verify that the person or entity offering it are registered.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Investment Scams in the Metaverse:<br /></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How to Protect Yourself from Losing Real Money in the Virtual World</strong></span></h2>
<p><em>For much of human existence, story tellers, science fiction writers, film makers, and technologists have fantasized about what virtual worlds might look like in the future. With advances in technology including more enhanced digital experiences that blur the line between the physical and digital worlds, the future has arrived in the form of the “metaverse.” A series of virtual worlds, the metaverse is the latest technology that for some people offers new ways to interact and collaborate, while others see it as new means to perpetrate financial scams and investment fraud. This alert highlights some current metaverse investment scams and discusses ways that investors can protect themselves.</em></p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>What is the Metaverse?</strong></h4>
<p>The metaverse is a term that generally refers to online virtual worlds that stand alone or are interconnected. These virtual worlds provide users with an immersive experience by utilizing virtual or augmented reality technologies. In metaverse virtual worlds, users can experience many of the things that people do in the physical world through digital representations of themselves, commonly referred to as avatars. An avatar can take on any appearance or personal attribute their real-world creator might desire (or can purchase). An avatar can even be “non-human” in appearance. The user can then send their avatar into the virtual world to explore, socialize, play, shop, work, and even invest.</p>
<p>The metaverse is increasingly viewed as the future of the internet. Large, well- known technology companies are already committed to developing the metaverse, so it’s likely to be something that people will be hearing about for many years to come. That said, there is no guarantee that the metaverse will evolve to the scale of today’s internet due to current technological limitations and other factors. And, as with every previous advance in technology or innovation, there will always be those who will seek to exploit the hype around the innovation to profit illegally from others. It is, therefore, important<br />to separate fact from fiction when considering a metaverse investment pitch.</p>
<hr />
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Investing and the Metaverse</strong></h4>
<p>What is novel about metaverse investing is that it is happening in both the real world and the virtual world. Metaverse-focused companies are raising money from real- world investors, while avatars are making investments inside metaverse virtual worlds. In both situations, however, real assets can be put at risk and transferred.</p>
<p>Companies building software, hardware, virtual networks and products for the metaverse are receiving money from investors in the traditional way – investors buy shares in or lend money to these companies expecting a return on their investment.</p>
<p>Inside the metaverse, there are numerous investment opportunities that are growing by the day. For example, metaverse users are investing in virtual real estate as well as nonfungible tokens (NFTs). There are also opportunities to invest in businesses operating inside of the metaverse.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Metaverse Scams are Here</strong></h4>
<p>Wherever there is excitement around a new industry or technology, fraudsters are bound to flock. The metaverse is no different. The lack of regulation in the metaverse and the ability to operate from anywhere in the world make it easy for fraudsters to hide their schemes. In addition, security lapses on developing platforms and the ability to build fake metaverse experiences can lead to hacks, fraud, or the theft of users’ funds.</p>
<p>Real-world metaverse scams are already here and can include illegal stock promotions, pump-and-dump campaigns, or Ponzi schemes with scammers offering investments in metaverse-focused companies or technologies. Scams inside metaverse virtual worlds can be similar to real-world scams, but they are likely to include a virtual component such as crypto assets or virtual real estate.</p>
<p>Regulators are taking notice. In May 2022, five state securities regulators filed enforcement actions against an organization with possible ties to Russia for allegedly promoting fraudulent metaverse investments to U. S. residents. The scheme involved offering NFTs to investors that claimed to convey ownership interest in a metaverse casino and the rights to share profits in the casino. Investors would purportedly profit when patrons, acting as avatars, paid to play virtual craps, blackjack and other games. Regulators further alleged the club lied about having a partnership with the physical Flamingo Casino in Las Vegas and failed to back claims that it was buying digital land from rapper and TV personality, Snoop Dogg.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Protect Yourself Against Metaverse Scams</strong></h4>
<p>New metaverse-focused scams and frauds will likely develop, so it is important to stay informed if you are considering investing in this emerging industry. You should also diligently guard your personal information, passwords, and financial information in the metaverse. Here are some simple tips on how to protect yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Most investment offerings are regulated. </strong>In most instances, any person or entity who offers or promotes some type of venture as an investment opportunity – whether in the real world or a virtual one – must be registered with one or more securities regulators. The same is true for most investments themselves. If the person or the entity is not registered, there is a real risk that the solicitation is fraudulent, and the investment is a scam. The easiest way to protect yourself is to contact the securities regulator in your jurisdiction<sup>1</sup> to verify that the investment and the person/entity offering it are registered. Remember, though, that registration does not necessarily mean the investment is a good one or right for you.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t fall for the hype! Look beyond the flashy online marketing. </strong>Fraudsters use popular and emerging social networks to push out hundreds, even thousands, of posts to promote illegal investment offers. They may also create videos that will circulate widely on various platforms to explain how and why the investment is the next big thing. Even if a video, post, or article receives a lot of views, likes, or comments, it does not mean the investment offer is real or worth investing in.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid discussing investments with avatars. </strong>Fraudsters will chat with you about an investment offer if you let them. In the metaverse, avatars add another layer of complexity, because you may feel some commonality with the way a person has chosen to portray or represent themself. If someone brings up investing, asks you for money, or discusses finances, it’s best to move on to a different topic. If they are persistent, it’s probably a good idea to avoid the person, and their avatar, altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t share personal or account information. </strong>The metaverse is designed to encourage immersive, one-on-one interaction with others through avatars and virtual spaces. Such interactions may build trust and users may divulge their personal financial information or passwords, thinking that the individual they are interacting with is a trustworthy friend. Scammers are good at building trust – both online and in the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Steer clear of metaverse crypto or NFT investment offers. </strong>Crypto asset scams have dominated the headlines for the past few years. Fraudsters have stolen billions from investors through various means, including fake NFT and cryptocurrency offers. Rug pulls, also known as pump and dumps, are a common scam. This happens when fraudsters feverishly promote an NFT or crypto project, causing the perceived value of the asset or project to rise, and then abandon it, taking investors’ money and leaving them with a now-worthless digital asset.</p>
<p><strong>Be wary of fake news and online celebrity gossip. </strong>Scammers write fake online articles and social media posts that create buzz by falsely stating a celebrity or public figure is involved in a technology investment. They are playing on the fact that this individual is known to invest or have an interest in online trends or financial innovations, like NFTs or crypto. These posts and articles are often part of an online misinformation campaign aimed at attracting investors.</p>
<p><strong>Verify information by making direct real-world contact. </strong>Fraudsters may use the name of a real-world business to legitimize a fake investment or financial service offered in the metaverse. Many companies are still evaluating whether to operate in the metaverse. It is best, therefore, to verify metaverse investment promotions by making direct contact with a representative of the real-world business or brand outside of the virtual world where you encountered the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding investment advice in the metaverse. </strong>Firms and individuals that provide investment advisory services in the U.S. are typically registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or one or more state securities regulators. In Canada, firms and individuals must be registered with the securities regulators in the provinces and territories where they operate. Check with your state securities regulator, the SEC’s <a href="https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/">Investment Adviser Public Disclosure </a>database, or FINRA’s <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/">BrokerCheck </a>to verify the registration of status of individuals or firms. In Canada, use the CSA’s <a href="http://info.securities-administrators.ca/nrsmobile/nrssearch.aspx">National Registration Search</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Look for investment fraud red flags. </strong>Fraudsters may say a metaverse investment has little or no risk, while offering guarantees that your money will be safe because you are part of an online community. Remember: every investment comes with risk, and no investment can be guaranteed. Understand the risks and make sure you are comfortable with them, including the possibility that you might lose your entire investment. Review NASAA’s Warning Signs of Fraud (<a href="https://www.nasaa.org/investor-education/warning-signs-of-fraud/">https://</a> <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/investor-education/warning-signs-of-fraud/">www.nasaa.org/investor-education/warning-signs-of-fraud/</a>) to understand common tactics fraudsters use to scam people.</p>

<hr />
<h4><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The Bottom Line</span></strong></h4>
<p>The metaverse offers the opportunity to experience fully immersive virtual worlds that may seem very much like the physical world we wake up to everyday, as well as fantastical worlds built on alternate realities. Nevertheless, people should know that the rules that apply to investments in the physical world also apply to investments in virtual worlds. When considering any investment, you should watch for signs of fraud, and objectively consider all the information available to you before purchasing it. If you suspect fraud or illegal activity, reach out to your state or provincial securities regulator immediately.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – (August 23, 2022) – Securities regulators, financial industry leaders, and investor advocates across North America will convene in Nashville, Tennessee, September 18-20 for the North American Securities Administrators Association’s (NASAA) 2022 Fall Annual Meeting.</p>
<p>Themed “Strategies for Success in the Volunteer State,” the meeting recognizes the visionary and vital role that state and provincial securities regulators play in protecting investors from financial fraud and abuse and administering regulatory frameworks through which companies raise money. The meeting will include multiple speakers, panels and sessions that focus on regulatory issues related to emerging models for digital assets, the business landscape through the lens of minority and women entrepreneurs, and current issues facing capital formation for start-ups and small businesses. Another discussion centers on how the meme stock frenzy of January 2021 sparked unique issues for market regulation. The meeting will be held both in-person and with sessions available online.</p>
<p>“The NASAA Fall Annual Meeting provides an excellent opportunity for dialogue and information sharing on the regulatory and investor protection issues facing Main Street investors and the securities industry,” said NASAA President Melanie Senter Lubin, who also serves as Maryland Securities Commissioner.</p>
<p>The meeting’s featured speakers include J.P. Morgan Managing Director Dr. Tucker Balch, who will deliver remarks on artificial intelligence research in the financial markets on Monday, September 19. In addition, NASAA President-Elect Andrew Hartnett, Deputy Administrator for Securities for the Iowa Insurance Division, will participate in a fireside chat on Tuesday, September 20 to discuss NASAA’s priorities during his upcoming year as NASAA President.</p>
<p>The meeting begins on Sunday, September 18 with a panel led by 2022 Annual Meeting Chair and Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance Assistant Commissioner Elizabeth Bowling examining capital formation for start-ups and small businesses. The second panel, moderated by Ohio Division of Securities Deputy Attorney Inspector Harvey McCleskey and Georgia Division of Securities and Business Regulation Director Noula Zaharis, will examine the challenges facing women and minority entrepreneurs. The third panel, moderated by Delaware Investor Protection Unit Director Jillian Lazar, will explore how regulators can better anticipate and address the opportunities and challenges that arise as more investors turn to online advisors. The final panel will focus on protecting investors and consumers in the age of digital assets. It will be moderated by New Brunswick Financial and Consumer Services Commission Director of Information Technology and Regulatory Informatics Jake van der Laan.</p>
<p>The meeting will also offer attendees an opportunity to learn about the work underway at NASAA and its various Section Committees and project groups. The presentations will cover a broad array of specific topics from the regulation of investment advisers and broker-dealers to enforcement trends, investor education, and corporation finance initiatives.</p>
<p>“We will offer our attendees an outstanding lineup of speakers and presentations and encourage all to join in a vital discussion on investor protection,” said Annual Meeting Chair Elizabeth Bowling. “We are proud to welcome securities regulators and industry members from across North America to Nashville.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – (August 9, 2022) – The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/64940/informed-investor-advisory-finfluencers/?qoid=investor-advisories">today issued an Informed Investor Advisory</a> recommending investors use caution when considering advice from social media financial influencers, or “finfluencers.”</p>
<p>A finfluencer is a person who, by virtue of their popular or cultural status, has the capability to influence the financial decision-making process of others through promotions or recommendations on social media, according to the NASAA Informed Investor Advisory. They may seek to influence potential investors by publishing posts or videos to their social media accounts, often stylized to be entertaining so that the post or video will be shared with other potential investors.</p>
<p>“Investors should keep in mind that finfluencers are not subject to the same regulations as licensed financial professionals and may have undisclosed conflicts of interest,” said NASAA President Melanie Senter Lubin. “Before you consider investing or acting on advice from a social media personality, make sure you understand all the ins and outs of the investment including all potential risks.”</p>
<p>The advisory includes information to help investors better understand how influencers operate, what to consider when coming across financial advice on social media, and where to go for help with concerns about a possible finfluencer. The advisory also points out red flags to consider including dubious advice, unverifiable or outdated financial credentials, or investment recommendations not backed up by accurate data.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is that before making any financial decisions about your money, ask questions and make sure you understand the risks, and before you invest check on the registration status of the person and the investment with your jurisdiction’s securities regulator,” Lubin said.</p>
<p>The finfluencer advisory as well as contact information for state and provincial <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/contact-your-regulator/">securities regulators</a> is available on the NASAA website at <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/">nasaa.org</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – (August 4, 2022) – On July 12, 2022, NASAA released a Notice Requesting Public Comment on Proposed Revisions to NASAA&#8217;s Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts. The original deadline for submitting public comments was August 11, 2022. NASAA’s Corporation Finance Section Committee received a letter from a group of industry trade associations on Tuesday, August 2, requesting a 30-day extension to the public comment period. The Committee met with one of those industry associations on Wednesday, August 3, who offered compelling reasons for its request. NASAA’s Corporation Finance Section Committee has decided to grant the request and is extending the public comment deadline for all commenters to Monday, September 12, 2022.</p>
<p>“This proposal is six years in the making following the release of the first iteration back in 2016,” said NASAA Corporation Finance Section Committee Chair Andrea Seidt who also serves as Ohio Securities Commissioner. “NASAA’s existing investor income and net worth standards have not been adjusted for inflation in over 15 years. If one additional month gives industry stakeholders the time they need to fully frame their thinking and provide data that is responsive to NASAA’s proposal, the Committee is more than happy to grant the extension.”</p>
<p>The Committee thanks everyone who has submitted a comment to date and encourages all interested parties to submit their comments on or before the new deadline of September 12. An updated version of the Request for Public Comment that has the new deadline listed can be found on <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Request_for_Public_Comment_on_Amendments_to_NASAA_REIT_Guidelines_Extended-1.pdf">NASAA&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Financial Advice via Social Media – the Rise<br />of the “Finfluencer”</strong></span></h2>
<p><em>Social media has become one of the main ways in which people connect to one another. This has been especially true during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person contact was viewed by many as risky. With newsworthy stock market volatility dominating Main Street news headlines since early 2020, interest in investing has seen a dramatic increase. According to Bloomberg News, downloads of investment apps rose by 20% in 2021 from the year prior while actual time spent on these apps jumped by 90%. Most Millennials and Gen Z-ers are using social media sources for information about investing rather than relying on more traditional sources of investing information such as brokerage or investment advisory firms.<br /></em></p>
<p><em>Influencers have taken notice and social media has become more saturated with financial content than ever before, leading to the rise of the financial influencer or “finfluencer.” Viral videos proclaiming that this or that investment opportunity will “go to the moon this year!” have proliferated, as have social media postings promoting easy plans for paying off your house, car, or student loan debt using language such as “Five easy tricks to financial freedom.”<br /></em></p>
<p><em>This investor advisory explains what financial influencers are, how they are compensated, what you should keep in mind when you are exposed to financial influencers’ content, red flags to watch out for, and resources available to you.<br /></em></p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>What is a financial influencer (“finfluencer”)?</strong></h4>
<p>A finfluencer is a person who, by virtue of their popular or cultural status, has the ability to influence the financial decision-making process of others through promotions or recommendations on social media. They may influence potential buyers by publishing posts or videos to their social media accounts, often stylized to be entertaining so that the post or video will be shared with other potential buyers. The financial influencer may be compensated by the business offering the product or service, the platform on which the message appears, or an undisclosed financier. While there is nothing new about marketers paying celebrities to endorse their products, what IS different is that such breezy and hyper-emotional endorsements are being made in what is otherwise a very regulated industry with stringent rules about performance claims and disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. Remember, investment promoters generally must provide potential investors with all information relevant to making an informed investment decision. Finfluencers are testing the limits of what is considered regulated investment advice and protected free speech.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong><em>Fiona Finfluencer enters into agreements with several companies to promote via her Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitter accounts the company’s products and services for cryptocurrency trading accounts, real estate investing, and a start-up company that grows loofahs.</em></p>
<p><em>The cryptocurrency trading platform pays Fiona $25 per person that she pushes to its platform. The real estate investment company compensates Fiona a flat monthly fee plus a bonus depending on how many people participate in their investments based on Fiona’s recommendations. The loofah company compensates Fiona with a monthly flat fee, equity in the company, and free use of its products. Fiona discloses none of this to her social media followers.</em></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<hr />
<h4>What should you consider when you come across financial advice on social media?</h4>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finfluencers should disclose compensation they receive.</strong> Government laws protect consumers by requiring that advertisements – including product endorsements by social media influencers – must be truthful and disclose all relevant conflicts of interest. But regulators cannot possibly police every advertisement or endorsement. Consumers thus should not assume that a finfluencer is disclosing everything that they ought to be disclosing.</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment for the masses, not individual advice.</strong> While brokerage firms, banks, and investment advisers work with individual clients, finfluencers try to curate as large a following as possible to achieve a high volume of views. While some finfluencers may work in the financial services industry, many more do not. Finfluencers should, but may not, disclose to their followers that their social media content is not a replacement for individualized financial advice.</li>
<li><strong>Limited direct recourse.</strong> Finfluencers are not generally required to submit to government regulation. Indeed, a finfluencer’s speech may be broadly protected by law. As discussed above, some laws and regulations apply to help protect consumers, but investors likely will have limited ability to recover from a finfluencer who turns out to be a fraudster or a know-nothing pretending to be a professional.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Watch out for Red Flags</h4>
<p><strong>Dubious Advice.</strong> While some financial content may include helpful advice like the basics of financial literacy, other content might include reckless advice (<em>e.g.</em>, “Avoid Paying Your Debts” or “Avoid Making Your Next Mortgage Payment Using this HACK!”) that could result in serious financial consequences, including a lowered credit score, losing significant amounts of hard-earned money, or civil or criminal actions being brought against you. Similar to investment opportunities, if it sounds too good or too crazy or too reckless to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p><strong>Credentials Check. </strong>If the finfluencer claims to hold a financial certification or designation of any kind, check to see if the certification or designation comes from an accredited organization and if the finfluencer is currently in good standing. You can also check with your local securities regulator to see if the person is registered to provide investment advice and recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Show Me the Data.</strong> Some finfluencers build their following by promising “to the moon” stock picks or investment strategies on a regular basis. While some of these recommendations may increase in value, there may be tens or hundreds more that go bust or lose value, or strategies that fail. Take these recommendations with a shaker full of salt and ask for the data to back up the claims the finfluencer is making. If they only promote their “amazing” results, they are likely too good to be true. Remember, finfluencers are making content for their own financial gain – if their strategies and picks worked out so well, is there a reason they are spending hours making social media content?</p>
<hr />
<h4>Where to Go for Help</h4>
<p>If you have concerns about a finfluencer, you should act. You can contact the social media platform through which the finfluencer is spreading their message to make the platform aware of your concerns. Reputable social media platforms have no interest in being conduits for fraud, and the platform may shut down the finfluencer if the platform finds violations of its policies or misconduct by the finfluencer. In addition, you can contact federal, state, provincial, or territorial regulators via NASAA. To contact your securities regulator, please visit www.nasaa.org/contact-your-regulator.</p>
<hr />
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">The Bottom Line</span></h4>
<p>While celebrities and other well-known personalities may be very good at what they do in their respective professions, that does not necessarily mean they should be looked to for investment advice. Investing is an individualized endeavor where success looks different for everyone. Endorsements about financial products should be treated with skepticism and subjected to the same scrutiny and consideration given to making any other major business decision. Ask yourself: “Why is this person endorsing this investment and how does it fit in my financial picture?” It may turn out that they are simply being paid to sell it, and that they don’t care if it suits your needs or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color: #336699;">NASAA President Melanie Senter Lubin to Highlight Scams and Risks Facing Investors and Urge Passage of Laws to Strengthen Investor Trust in the Public Capital Markets</span></strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – (July 28, 2022) – North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) President and Maryland Securities Commissioner Melanie Senter Lubin will testify during a hearing to be held today at 10:00 a.m. ET by the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to discuss scams and risks to investors in the crypto and securities markets.</p>
<p>Commissioner Lubin will focus her remarks on top threats to retail investors, including fraudulent investments tied to digital assets, social media and online scams, and schemes connected to self-directed individual retirement accounts.</p>
<p>In addition, Commissioner Lubin will urge Congress to advance measures to strengthen the prevention and detection of investor harm, to ensure those charged with enforcing the law have the tools needed to do the job, and to refrain from rushing into legislation related to digital assets without first engaging in a robust policy-making process.</p>
<p>Commissioner Lubin will also highlight NASAA member activity to combat investor fraud in the digital asset space, as well as frauds involving both registered and unregistered persons and firms.</p>
<p>In advance of the hearing, Commissioner Lubin stated, “NASAA and its members have led efforts in the United States to investigate and, if appropriate, pursue action against hundreds of companies and individuals for fraud or similar misconduct relating to digital assets. It is imperative that investors today be especially vigilant when it comes to making decisions on how to invest their money and whom they entrust to help them with those important decisions.”</p>

<p>Other panelists will include John Cochran, Commissioner of the Indiana Securities Division, Emily Kisicki, Director of Policy for the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation, and Francswai Grayson, Director of Communication and Outreach for the Utah Division of Securities.</p>
<p>“Whistleblower complaints often serve as the basis for investigations into possible securities law violations,” said NASAA President Melanie Senter Lubin, who also serves as Maryland Securities Commissioner. “Our intent with the Model Whistleblower Award and Protection Act is to provide a safe environment for whistleblowers to come forward, which in turn provides securities regulators a greater opportunity to stop the alleged misconduct and prevent harm to Main Street investors.”</p>
<p>NASAA’s model act, where adopted, provides a  state’s securities regulator with the authority to make monetary awards to whistleblowers of up to 30 percent of the amount of monetary sanctions collected in a related administrative or judicial action. The model act also protects whistleblower confidentiality, prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee for engaging in whistleblowing and related activities, and creates a cause of action under which an employee can sue its employer for retaliation.</p>
<p>“NASAA’s mission is to protect investors from investment fraud and abuse,” said Hartnett. “The NASAA panel will reinforce the importance of whistleblowers’ efforts to alert authorities to potential wrongdoing and highlight the potential benefits of the model act.”</p>
<p>On March 25, 2021, Montana became the first state to enact <a href="https://csimt.gov/wp-content/uploads/HB-64-Whistleblower.pdf">legislation</a> based on NASAA’s model act.</p>
